We explore the data to get a sense of the experience, income, popular languages and countries of the programmers surveyed _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.

#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)

The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select "Run on Colab" or "Run on Kaggle", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
This tutorial covers the following topics:

- Reading a CSV file into a Pandas data frame
- Retrieving data from Pandas data frames
