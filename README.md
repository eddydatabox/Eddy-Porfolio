# Analyzing Tabular Data using Python and Pandas

### How to run the code

This tutorial is an executable [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai). You can _run_ this tutorial and experiment with the code examples in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your computer*.

#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)

The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**. You can also select "Run on Colab" or "Run on Kaggle", but you'll need to create an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) to use these platforms.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

- Reading a CSV file into a Pandas data frame
- Retrieving data from Pandas data frames
- Querying, soring, and analyzing data
- Merging, grouping, and aggregation of data
- Extracting useful information from dates
- Basic plotting using line and bar charts
